# Additional Carbon Accountability

This code is used to estimate the Additional Carbon Accountability for 37 countries based on the countries' carbon debt and future excessive carbon claims on a remaining global carbon budget for holding the global average temperature increase below 1.5°C with a 50% probability. The code also estimates results for a set of sensitivity cases of our method for a different starting year for historical responsibility, a different allocation principle for fair shares of the remaining global carbon budget, and for a global carbon budget in line with holding the global average temperature increase below 2°C with 83% probability.
