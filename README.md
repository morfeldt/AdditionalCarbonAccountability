# Additional Carbon Accountability

This supplementary R script is part of the scientific manuscript by **Hahn el al. Estimating countries' additional carbon accountability for closing the mitigation gap based on past and future emissions**, submitted to *Nature Communications* for public sharing, reproduction and validation of the results we present in the manuscript.

The script allows you to reproduce and follow each of the calculation steps in the manuscript to estimate this 'additional carbon accountability' for 37 countries based on the countries' carbon debt and future surplus carbon claims on a remaining global carbon budget to keep the global average temperature increase below 1.5°C with a 50% probability.

The code also estimates results for a number of sensitivity cases of our method for a different starting year for historical responsibility, a different allocation principle for fair shares of the remaining global carbon budget, and for a global carbon budget consistent with keeping the global average temperature increase below 2°C with 83% probability.

## How to Download and Use R Code

1) Download Script and data: Download the R script along with any associated datasets. Download everything into one folder, or clone the entire repository using Git (with `git clone`)

2)  Open and Run R Script: Open the R script with e.g. RStudio and run the code

**Note:** Make sure you set the working directory to the source-file location for the script to find the accompanying data files.
